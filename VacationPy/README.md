VacationPy

Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.

* **Note:** Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure you can't be charged. Check out [Google Maps Platform Billing](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing/gmp-billing#monitor-and-restrict-consumption) and [Manage your cost of use](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage-and-billing#set-caps) for more information.

* **Note:** if you having trouble displaying the maps, try running `jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps` in your environment and retry.

To complete this part of the assignment,you will need to do the following:

* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I.

* Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.

  * **Note:** Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.

* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.

As final considerations:

* You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
* You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
* For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission.
* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
* For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.
